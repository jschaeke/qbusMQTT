# QbusMQTT
A Qbus EQOweb to MQTT bridge

#Purpose
This perl script acts a bridge between an MQTT broker and a Qbus home automation system (Ecoweb). By doing so, Qbus can be integrated into home automation software solutions such as Domogik, OpenHab, Domoticz,... 

#Documentation
None so far

#Installation
Install perl with all the necessary dependencies (TODO for me to add here), create a qbusMQTT.ini with the properties of the MQTT broker (such as Mosquitto) and Ecoweb.

#Thanks
I want to thank Bart Boelaert for publishing the initial library I've included into this project (http://bartboelaert.blogspot.be/2015/01/interfacing-qbus-building-intelligence.html). Sorry Bart if I messed it up, I am not a perl coder. This was just a little project to help a friend with a Qbus installation..
